Hi John!

Just popping in to remind you about our Skool community - it's the perfect place to join us for weekly coaching calls every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern time. And guess what? It's absolutely free! We're on the verge of reaching our 500-user milestone, and we'd be thrilled to have you as part of our growing community.

During our last chat, we talked about your project timeline and requirements. I'm confident that Skool will be an invaluable resource for you to network and seek support for your projects.

By the way, if you're digging the AI-related content, don't forget to check out more videos on my channel. Don't hesitate to hit that 'like' button and subscribe to stay in the loop with the latest content.

Hope to see you in the community!

Warm regards,
Brandon Hancock
