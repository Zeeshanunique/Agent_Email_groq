Hi Alice!

Just popping in to remind you about our Skool community, your go-to place for weekly coaching calls every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern time. The community is thriving and we're about to hit the 500 user milestone. As a frontend developer with a passion for user experience design, we think you'd be a fantastic addition to our group!

Got questions or need a hand with projects? This is the perfect spot to link up with like-minded people and get the support you need.

By the way, if you're digging the AI-themed content, don't forget to explore other videos on my channel. And hey, while you're there, show some love by hitting that like button and subscribing. That way, you'll never miss out on the latest updates!

Can't wait to see you in the community!

Warm regards,
Brandon Hancock
